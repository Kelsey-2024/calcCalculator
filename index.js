/*Create a calculator using the following functions
- getSum - adds two numbers
- getDividend - divides two numbers
- getProduct - multiplies two numbers
- getDifference - subtracts two numbers
- inverseNumber - returns the number as a positive or negative based on input
- convertPercentageToDecimal - takes in a percentage and returns the number as a decimal
- getRandomInteger - gets a random integer
- getPi - returns 3.14
- getRemainder - returns the remainder if two numbers are divided
- getSquareRoot - returns the square root of a number
- Do not show -0
- Return a helpful message instead of NaN if there is an error
When done writing the functions, invoke the functions multiple times and use the results to call other functions

//like an actual calculator we'll have "buttons"
  //each button will be an if statement for the following functions
  // **pause**



//Write a helpful message as my else statement > would we do a nested if > else statement?
